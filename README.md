# sw_project

1. Make sure that all your code is merged to the Main branch
2. Include all files necessary to run your app, NOT just the source code
3. Here is an example of how we will test your code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
pipenv install flask

pipenv install PyMySQL flask

pipenv shell

python server.py
```

The app should be running on `http://localhost:5001/`
